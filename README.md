# Predictive-Modelling-Using-Data-from-Indian-Startup-Funding

*Predictive Modelling Using Data from Indian Startup Funding Develop an advanced machine-learning model that forecasts funding for Indian startups based on key dataset features such as funding dates, industry verticals, locations, and amounts. 
*Begin by precisely cleaning the data, then engineer features that capture trends and conduct a focused exploratory analysis. Experiment with advanced feature combinations and regression algorithms that are tailored to the challenges of the dataset.
*Optimise hyperparameters, add custom metrics and create visualizations to show predictions and feature impacts. Discuss deployment challenges and concerns about ethics.
